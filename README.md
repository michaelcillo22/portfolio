# My Portfolio
## Here is my Portfolio Website
This website is powered by GitHub Pages
and was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and BootStrap

## How to Run
- Upon opening index.html you may use the Nav Bar on top for quick links.
- You may also click the icons under Title Lead to get to my socials
- Under Projects, you may either click on 'Deploy' or 'Source Code'


## Future Improvements: 
1. More Project Developments as I move forward with my career as a Full Stack Developer. 
2. Labels per Project on which Programming Languages were utilized
3. 1:11 minute video of me introducing myself
4. Have a way on contacting me besides email.
5. Include Resume onto Nav Bar or Title
6. Make a section under first div for Programming Languages Icons (MongoDB, Express, React, Node, JS, CSS, HTML, GitHUb, VSCode, ios, GoLang, etc.)
7. Sharpen the HTML sections and CSS designs
